This tutorial series will help you set up the Vim or Neovim text editors for efficiently writing LaTeX documents.
Here is an example of what I have in mind:

The blue bar with white text shows the keys I am typing, the bottom shows the resulting LaTeX source code, and the top is the compiled output.
More on how this works below.

**Goal of this guide:** make writing LaTeX as easy (fast, efficient, enjoyable...) as writing math by hand.
Tech stack: the Vim text editor using the UltiSnips snippet plugin and the VimTeX plugin's LaTeX editing features.
The series should help if you...

- are interested in taking real-time lecture notes using LaTeX, Ã  la [Gilles Castel](https://castel.dev/),
- want a LaTeX experience decidedly more pleasant and efficient than whatever you were probably first taught, whether your motivation is real-time university lecture speed or not,
- hope to switch to Vim from a different LaTeX editor, but are unsure how to proceed, or
- just want to browse someone else's workflow and configuration out of curiosity.

**What it costs you:** everything in the guide is free, but it will cost you time and effort.
You can skim through the guide in about 15-30 minutes; a closer read-through might take a few hours;
and you'll realistically need a few weekends (or perhaps a few weeks if you're new to Vim) of dedicated focus and effort to become fully functional.
From that point reaching the speed in this page's GIFs would probably take months of practice.
