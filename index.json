[{"categories":["latex","school","notes"],"content":"This tutorial series will help you set up Neovim for taking beautiful, effective, and easy notes that are easy to manage. Here is an example of what I have in mind: The goal of this series is to make writing LaTeX as easy (fast, efficient, enjoyable …) as writing math by hand and more enjoyable. This series should help you if: You’re interested in taking real-time lecture notes using LaTeX. You’re hoping to switch from a LaTeX editor you’re using to NeoVim, but are unsure on how to do so. You’re interested in learning more about LaTeX. Or, you’re completely new to the idea of taking notes using LaTeX or just LaTeX in general. Of course, this is going to come at a cost. Not financially, but time. If you’re completely new to NeoVim, then I’d recommend checking out The Primeagen’s series on that and spend about 2-3 weeks just getting comfortable with NeoVim. If you’re already comfortable with NeoVim, then it might take you a weekend, or even a week to get through this series. You can either: Take your time when reading these posts, which may take up to an hour to get through each one. Speed-read through everything, skipping the explanations and meaning for the code. In doing so, it’ll take you about 20 minutes to read each post. Overview My notes Configuration Editor: NeoVim Terminal: Xfce4-Terminal Colorscheme: Base16-Bright Font: Hack Nerd Font Mono Window Manager: Bspwm Gif Recorder: Menyoki Dotfiles: SingularisArt.
