Welcome to my website! Here, you'll find my projects, academia related stuff
such as notes, papers, etc, and a bunch of tutorials about stuff that I find
interesting, and I hope you do to.

## Tutorial Series

[Tutorials](/tutorials) that I've written, or am writing, about stuff that I
find interesting and that I wish I had when I was learning about them. Some of
them are a series, i.e., broken into multiple parts, as this one
[here](/tutorials/latex-notes/post-00).

## Projects

This is a curated list of all my favorite projects that I've made/working on.

## Academia
