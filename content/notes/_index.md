# Notes

Below are all the notes I've taken since high school. None of this is official.
In addition, I've included stripped down versions of the notes, such as
definition only. They are
[script](https://github.com/SingularisArt/school-setup/) generated. I've also
included the link to their source code, if available. Note that the lecture
notes are not reliable indicators for what was lectured in my year, or what will
be lectured in your year, as I tend to change, add and remove contents from the
notes after the lectures occur. You can view all my courses
[here](https://github.com/SingularisArt/LaTeX/tree/master/lecture-notes).
